c) Any software that incorporates or is derived from any part of RLMatrix, regardless of the amount of code used

7.2. Licensing Requirements:
Any work that falls under the scope defined in 7.1 is subject to the same licensing terms as the original RLMatrix software. This includes:

a) For works or code portions derived from the MIT-licensed version of RLMatrix:
   - The work MUST be licensed under the terms of this Comprehensive Dual License Agreement.
   - A copy of this entire license agreement MUST be included with any distribution of the work.
   - The work must clearly state that it uses or is based on RLMatrix and include a link to the original RLMatrix project.

   - The terms of the commercial license apply to the work.
   - Any distribution of the work must comply with the terms of the commercial license.

7.3. Users of Derivative Works or Partial Code:
Users of any work that falls under the scope defined in 7.1, whether created under the MIT license or commercial license, are subject to the same licensing criteria and commercial requirements as users of the original RLMatrix. Specifically:

a) Users who meet the criteria for the MIT license as specified in Section 3 may use the work under the MIT license terms.

b) Users who meet any of the criteria for the commercial license as specified in Section 2 MUST obtain a commercial license for their use of the work, even if the work itself was created under the MIT license.

The use of derivative works, partial code, or any incorporation of RLMatrix does not exempt any entity from the commercial licensing requirements. The commercial license criteria and requirements cannot be circumvented by using, creating, or incorporating any part of RLMatrix.

7.6. Burden of Proof:
In case of dispute, the burden of proving that code similar to RLMatrix was independently developed without use or reference to RLMatrix shall rest with the party making such a claim.
